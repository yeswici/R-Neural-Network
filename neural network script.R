# This R script involves the creation of three neural networks using a dataset 
# on heart disease information.  The purpose of this assignment is to build a 
# model that accurately predicts the class of the dependent variable "FSTAT," 
# which represents a patient's vital status at the time of their last follow-
# up session.  I will experiment with using different numbers of hidden layers
# and hidden layer nodes in each model.  At the end, I will evaluate the 
# accuracies of the three models to determine which set of parameters will 
# produce the most accurate predictions.



# This section of code covers opening the dataset and initializing the packages 
# that are used in this script.

# Sets the working directory for this assignment.  Please change this directory 
# to whichever directory you are using, and make sure that all files are placed 
# in that location.

# In order to run the neural network commands, we need to install the neuralnet 
# package:

# If you have not installed this package yet, remove the # symbol below.
# install.packages("neuralnet")

# Loads the neuralnet package into the system.
library("neuralnet")

# Opens the CSV file "whas1.csv".
heart_dis <- read.csv("whas1.csv", head=TRUE, sep=",")

# End of opening the dataset.



# This section of code covers data preprocessing.  It includes exploration of 
# the original dataset, removing variables, and dealing with missing values.

# Previews the heart disease dataset.
View(heart_dis)

# Displays the structure of the data.  This is necessary to see if there are 
# any unique identifiers (IDs) that can be removed.  Such variables are not 
# useful for the analysis and should be removed.
str(heart_dis)

# The first variable is an ID, and we remove it.
heart_dis <- heart_dis[, -1]

# Verifies that the ID variable has been removed.
str(heart_dis)

# Displays the descriptive statistics for all variables in the dataset.  This 
# shows whether all variables are numeric and if there are any missing values.
summary(heart_dis)

# Since all variables are numeric and there are no missing values, we do not 
# need to worry about these issues.

# Sets the input variables to the same scale, such that they have the same
# mean and standard deviation.
heart_dis[1:12] <- scale(heart_dis[1:12])

# Verifies that the variables are set to the same scale.  All variables 
# except for "fstat" should have a mean equal to 0.
summary(heart_dis)

# End of data preprocessing.



# This section of code covers the creation of the first neural network model. 
# It includes dividing the data into training and test datasets, creating and 
# visualizing the model, and analyzing the model on the training and test 
# datasets.

# Generates a random seed to allow us to reproduce the results.
set.seed(12345)

# The following code splits the dataset into a training set consisting of 
# 70% of the data and a test set containing 30% of the data.

test.data <- heart_dis[ind == 2, ]

# This command implements the neural network method on training data using 
# class as the dependent variable and all other variables as independent 
# variables.  We use one hidden layer with 2 nodes, and linear output set to 
# false for classification models.
